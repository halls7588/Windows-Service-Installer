# Windows-Service-Installer
Simple batch file used to install a service, set it to auto, set the service description, and have the service log in as a user in the domain.

## Deployment
To use this file, compile your windows service project. Copy this file into either the release or debug folder but the same folder as the project .exe file (or edit the path location, I just prefer to do it this way so that I donâ€™t have to keep changing the path if I move the folder.), right click and run as administrator, and enjoy.
